Project 3 Readme

1. When you push to the server, the git hook that we wrote puts the files that we want to put online into the ~/www directory so that they can be publicly-accessed. Then, it restarts the server. Its main purpose is to put code for the website online.
2. The python server publishes the ~/deploy directory online.
3. A bare repo contains project directories, and it also contains a .git directory that handles all of git's control files.
